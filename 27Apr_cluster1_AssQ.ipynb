        "Ans: \\\n",
        "\n",
        "There are **four main types** of clustering algorithms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Partition-based clustering**  \n",
        "   - Example: **K-Means**  \n",
        "   - Assumes: Data can be partitioned into **k distinct, non-overlapping groups**.  \n",
        "   - Approach: Assigns points to the nearest cluster center.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hierarchical clustering**  \n",
        "   - Example: **Agglomerative** or **Divisive Clustering**  \n",
        "   - Assumes: Data has a nested structure.  \n",
        "   - Approach: Builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) by merging or splitting clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Density-based clustering**  \n",
        "   - Example: **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**  \n",
        "   - Assumes: Clusters are **dense regions** of data separated by low-density areas.  \n",
        "   - Approach: Groups points that are closely packed together; handles noise well.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model-based clustering**  \n",
        "   - Example: **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**  \n",
        "   - Assumes: Data is generated from a mixture of underlying probability distributions.  \n",
        "   - Approach: Uses statistical models (like Gaussian distributions) to estimate clusters.\n",

        "### **Q2. What is K-means clustering, and how does it work?**\n",
        "Ans: \\\n",
        "\n",
        "**K-means** is a partition-based clustering algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
        "1. Choose **k** (number of clusters).\n",
        "2. Randomly initialize **k centroids**.\n",
        "3. Assign each point to the **nearest centroid**.\n",
        "4. Update centroids by computing the **mean** of all assigned points.\n",
        "5. Repeat steps 3–4 until centroids **don’t change significantly** (convergence).\n",
        "\n",
        "It tries to **minimize the total within-cluster variance** (distance of points from their centroid).\n",

        "- Simple and fast.\n",
        "- Works well on large datasets.\n",
        "- Easy to interpret and implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations:**\n",
        "- Needs to **predefine k** (number of clusters).\n",
        "- Sensitive to **initial centroids** and **outliers**.\n",
        "- Assumes **spherical clusters** (doesn't handle complex shapes well).\n",

        "\n",
        "Common methods to find optimal **k**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Elbow Method**  \n",
        "   - Plot number of clusters (k) vs. **inertia** (within-cluster sum of squares).\n",
        "   - Look for an \"elbow\" point where adding more clusters doesn’t reduce inertia much.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Silhouette Score**  \n",
        "   - Measures how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to others.\n",
        "   - Ranges from -1 to 1. **Higher is better.**\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Gap Statistic**  \n",
        "   - Compares the total within-cluster variation with that of random data.\n",
