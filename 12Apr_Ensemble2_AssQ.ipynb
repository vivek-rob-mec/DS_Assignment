        "### **Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?**\n",
        "Ans: \\\n",
        "Overfitting happens when a model learns not just the general patterns in the data but also the noise or random fluctuations. This means the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bagging is an ensemble technique where multiple models (usually decision trees) are trained on **different subsets** of the original data (created by **bootstrapping**, i.e., sampling with replacement). Then, the predictions of all models are **combined** (e.g., majority voting for classification or averaging for regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Decision Trees Overfit?\n",
        "Decision trees are **high-variance models**. A small change in the data can lead to a completely different tree. This makes them very sensitive to training data and prone to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  How Bagging Helps Reduce Overfitting:\n",
        "1. **Reduces Variance**:\n",
        "   - By training many decision trees on different random subsets, each tree captures **slightly different aspects** of the data.\n",
        "   - Averaging their predictions **smooths out the noise**, leading to a more stable and generalizable model.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reduces Model's Dependence on Specific Data Points**:\n",
        "   - Because each tree sees only a subset of the data, the model doesn't rely too much on any one sample. This helps in preventing memorization of noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error Cancellation**:\n",
        "   - Overfitting trees might make **different mistakes**, but when their outputs are combined, these errors **cancel out** to some extent.\n",
        "\n",
        ">  **Example**: Think of each tree as a student. One student may get a question wrong, but if we ask 100 students and take a vote, the majority will likely give the correct answer. Bagging does something similar.\n",
