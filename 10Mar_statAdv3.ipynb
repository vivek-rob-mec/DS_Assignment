        "* Example: The sample mean (𝑥̄) is a point estimate of the population mean (μ).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If the average height of a sample of 100 students is 165 cm, then 165 cm is the point estimate of the average height of the entire student population.\n",

        "2. Interval Estimate (Confidence Interval)\n",
        "* An interval or range of values used to estimate a population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It provides a confidence level, typically 95% or 99%, which reflects the probability that the interval contains the true parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A 95% confidence interval for the population mean might be (160 cm, 170 cm), meaning we are 95% confident the actual population mean lies within this range"

        "To estimate the **population mean** with a **99% confidence interval**, we'll use the formula for the confidence interval when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small:\n",
