        "In the case of **medical disease diagnosis**, particularly in **cancer detection**, **recall** is often the most important metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Problem Context:**\n",
        "- The goal is to identify whether a patient has a specific disease, such as **cancer**, based on test results, medical imaging, or genetic data.\n",
        "- **False negatives** (patients who actually have the disease but are incorrectly classified as healthy) are very dangerous because they mean that the patient will not receive treatment, which could lead to the disease progressing and potentially becoming life-threatening.\n",
        "- **False positives** (patients who do not have the disease but are incorrectly classified as positive) are less critical in this context because they can usually be resolved with follow-up tests, and the patient may receive extra monitoring or treatment, which, while an inconvenience, is far less harmful than missing a diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why Recall Matters:**\n",
        "- **Recall** measures how many of the actual positives (patients with the disease) were correctly identified by the model.  \n",
        "  $$[\n",
        "  \\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n",
        "  ]$$\n",
        "  A **high recall** means that the model is very good at identifying most of the patients who actually have the disease, minimizing the risk of missed diagnoses (false negatives).\n",
        "\n",
        "- In the context of **cancer detection**, **low recall** could result in **missed diagnoses** where patients with cancer are not identified and thus do not receive timely treatment. This could lead to worsening health outcomes, potentially causing the disease to spread and become more difficult to treat.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Impact of Recall in This Scenario:**\n",
        "- **High recall** ensures that the model identifies as many actual cancer patients as possible, which means those patients will be referred for further diagnostic tests and treatments as early as possible. Early detection is often critical for successful treatment and survival.\n",
        "- While **false positives** are not ideal (they may lead to unnecessary tests and anxiety), they are far less harmful than missing a cancer diagnosis, which could have life-threatening consequences."
