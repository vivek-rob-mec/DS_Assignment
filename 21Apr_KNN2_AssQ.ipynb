        "   - **What**: A process where the model selectively chooses the most informative data points to learn from, reducing the need for large datasets.\n",
        "   - **Benefit**: Efficiently improves performance with fewer labeled data points, especially useful when labeled data is expensive to obtain.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Augmentation**:\n",
        "   - **What**: Generate synthetic data points by perturbing the existing data (e.g., by adding noise or applying transformations).\n",
        "   - **Benefit**: Increases the size of the training set without the need for new data.\n",

        "   - **What**: Carefully design or select features to enhance the information content of each data point.\n",

        "   - **What**: Reduce the number of features using methods like **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) or **t-SNE**.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. **Sample Selection**:\n",
        "   - **What**: Use techniques like **Bootstrap sampling** or **Importance Sampling** to select a representative subset of the data.\n",
        "   - **Benefit**: Allows you to reduce the training set size while maintaining or improving model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Use Efficient Algorithms**:\n",
        "   - **What**: If the training set size is large, you can use more **efficient versions** of KNN, such as those implemented with **KD-Trees** or **Ball Trees** to speed up distance calculations.\n",
