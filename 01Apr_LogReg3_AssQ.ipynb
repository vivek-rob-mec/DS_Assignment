        "- **Understand the problem**: Clearly define what you are trying to classify (e.g., predicting types of flowers, animal species, etc.).\n",
        "- **Identify the classes**: Determine the classes you need to predict. In multiclass classification, these could be categories like \"Apple,\" \"Banana,\" \"Orange.\"\n",
        "- **Set success metrics**: Decide how you will measure success (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.).\n",

        "- **Feature engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to help the model.\n",
        "- **Handle class imbalance**: If one class is underrepresented, consider using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights.\n",
        "- **Feature scaling/normalization**: For models like logistic regression or SVM, ensure that features are scaled to a similar range (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or Standardization).\n",
        "- **Data splitting**: Split the data into **training**, **validation**, and **test sets** (commonly a 70%-15%-15% split).\n",
