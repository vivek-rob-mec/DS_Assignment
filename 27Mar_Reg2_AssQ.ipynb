        "Ans: \\\n",
        "**R-squared** (denoted as $( R^2 )$) is a statistical measure used in linear regression models to evaluate how well the model fits the data. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Calculation of R-squared**:\n",
        "R-squared is calculated using the following formula:\n",

        "  \n",
        "  For example, if \\( R^2 = 0.85 \\), this means that 85% of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable(s) in the model, while the remaining 15% is due to factors not included in the model or random variation.\n",

        "- **Range**: R-squared values range from 0 to 1:\n",
        "  - $( R^2 = 0 )$: The model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean. The independent variable has no explanatory power.\n",
        "  - $( R^2 = 1 )$: The model explains all of the variability of the response data around its mean. This means the model perfectly fits the data (though this is rare in real-world scenarios).\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Model Fit**: A higher $( R^2 )$ indicates a better fit of the model to the data, but it's not always the best indicator of model quality. In some cases, a very high $( R^2 )$ can indicate overfitting, where the model captures noise in the data rather than the underlying relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Limitations of R-squared**:\n",
        "1. **Overfitting**: As more predictors are added to a model, R-squared will tend to increase, even if the new predictors do not actually improve the model. This can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too tailored to the training data and does not generalize well to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **No indication of causality**: R-squared does not tell us about causality or the direction of the relationship between variables, just how well the model fits the data.\n",

        "Ans: \\\n",
        "\n",
        "**Adjusted R-squared** is a modified version of R-squared that accounts for the number of predictors in the model. Unlike regular R-squared, which can only increase as more predictors are added to a regression model (even if those predictors are irrelevant), adjusted R-squared provides a more accurate measure of the model’s goodness-of-fit, particularly when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Key Differences Between R-squared and Adjusted R-squared**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Effect of Adding More Predictors**:\n",
        "   - **R-squared**: As you add more predictors to the model, R-squared will always increase or stay the same (it cannot decrease), even if the new predictors do not have a meaningful relationship with the dependent variable. This can lead to overfitting.\n",
        "   - **Adjusted R-squared**: Adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It will **increase** only if the new predictor improves the model more than would be expected by chance, and it will **decrease** if the new predictor does not improve the model sufficiently. This prevents the misleading increase in R-squared due to unnecessary predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Penalty for Overfitting**:\n",
        "   - **R-squared**: Does not penalize for overfitting. It simply reflects how well the model fits the data, even if the model is overfitted by including irrelevant variables.\n",
        "   - **Adjusted R-squared**: Penalizes the model for including too many predictors, thereby giving a more accurate assessment of the model's true explanatory power. This is especially useful when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interpretation**:\n",
        "   - **R-squared**: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model, but it can be inflated with too many predictors.\n",
        "   - **Adjusted R-squared**: Also represents the proportion of variance explained, but it is more reliable because it adjusts for the number of predictors, making it a better metric for comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Range of Values**:\n",
        "   - **R-squared**: Ranges from 0 to 1. It can never be negative.\n",
        "   - **Adjusted R-squared**: Can be negative if the model is very poor and doesn't fit the data well. It can also be smaller than R-squared because of the penalty for unnecessary predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why Adjusted R-squared is Important**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Model Comparison**: Adjusted R-squared is particularly useful when you are comparing models with a different number of independent variables. A higher adjusted R-squared means a better model fit, but it also means that the model is not simply overfitting the data by using too many predictors.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Overfitting Prevention**: While regular R-squared will keep increasing as more variables are added, adjusted R-squared will help you determine whether those new variables truly improve the model or whether they’re just adding noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example**:\n",
        "Suppose you have a model with three predictors, and its regular ( R^2 ) is 0.85. If you add a fourth predictor that doesn't have a real relationship with the dependent variable, regular ( R^2 ) may increase, say to 0.86. However, adjusted ( R^2 ) could decrease or increase only slightly, depending on how much the fourth predictor contributes to the model. This gives you a better idea of whether the additional predictor is truly adding value."

        "\n",
        "2. **When trying to avoid overfitting**:  \n",
        "   Adding too many variables can make your model overly complex and too tailored to the training data. Adjusted R-squared helps guard against this by penalizing the model for unnecessary variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **During feature selection**:  \n",
        "   When you're deciding which variables to include in your model, adjusted R-squared gives a clearer picture of whether a variable is really contributing to the model, helping you choose a simpler and more effective set of features.\n",
