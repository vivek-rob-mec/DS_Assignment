        "\n",
        "**Elastic Net Regression** is a linear regression model that combines the strengths of both **Ridge Regression** and **Lasso Regression** through a **mix of L1 and L2 regularization**.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  **Formula:**\n",
        "\n",
        "$$[\n",
        "\\text{Loss} = \\text{RSS} + \\lambda_1 \\sum |\\beta_j| + \\lambda_2 \\sum \\beta_j^2\n",
        "]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Or more commonly written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$[\n",
        "\\text{Loss} = \\text{RSS} + \\lambda \\left[ \\alpha \\sum |\\beta_j| + (1 - \\alpha) \\sum \\beta_j^2 \\right]\n",
        "]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- **RSS**: Residual Sum of Squares\n",
        "- **$( \\lambda $)**: Regularization strength\n",
        "- **$( \\alpha )$**: Mixing parameter (between Lasso and Ridge)\n",
        "  - $( \\alpha = 1 $): Lasso\n",
        "  - $( \\alpha = 0 $): Ridge\n",
        "  - $( 0 < \\alpha < 1 $): Elastic Net\n",
        "\n",
        "####  **How it's different**:\n",
        "- **OLS (Linear Regression)**: No regularization, can overfit.\n",
        "- **Ridge Regression**: Shrinks coefficients but **does not eliminate** any.\n",
        "- **Lasso Regression**: Shrinks and can **eliminate features**.\n",
        "- **Elastic Net**: **Combines both** â€” good for:\n",

        "####  Methods to choose optimal values:\n",
        "1. **Grid Search with Cross-Validation**:\n",
        "   - Define a range for $( \\alpha $) and $( \\lambda $).\n",
        "   - Use **K-fold cross-validation** to test each pair and find the combination that minimizes validation error.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ElasticNetCV** (in `scikit-learn`):\n",
        "   - Automates the process.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNetCV\n",

        "####  **Advantages**:\n",
        "- **Feature selection** (like Lasso) and **coefficient shrinkage** (like Ridge).\n",

        "\n",
        "####  **Disadvantages**:\n",
        "- Requires tuning of **two hyperparameters**.\n",
        "- Can be **less interpretable** than Lasso if many features are retained.\n",
        "- May **retain more features** than Lasso, even if some are weak predictors.\n",

        "\n",
        "Elastic Net is commonly used when:\n",
        "- You expect that **some features are irrelevant** (like Lasso).\n",

        "\n",
        "####  Common use cases:\n",
        "- **Genomics**: Where many genes may be correlated.\n",
        "- **Finance**: For selecting significant factors affecting stock returns.\n",
        "- **Marketing**: Identifying key drivers of customer behavior from many variables.\n",
        "- **Medical research**: With thousands of biomarkers, Elastic Net can identify important predictors.\n",

        "\n",
        "- A **non-zero coefficient** indicates that a feature contributes to the prediction.\n",
        "- A **zero coefficient** means the feature was **excluded** (like in Lasso).\n",

        "- You interpret non-zero coefficients the same way as in linear regression:  \n",
        "  > A one-unit increase in the predictor leads to a change in the response variable, holding other variables constant.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Elastic Net (like most models) **does not handle missing values directly**. You must **preprocess the data**.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Methods to handle missing data:\n",
        "1. **Imputation**:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Delete rows** with missing values (if only a few and not critical).\n",
        "3. **Use pipelines** to integrate imputation with model training.\n",
