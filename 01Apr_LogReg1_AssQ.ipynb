        "**Problem:**  \n",
        "- Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are **highly correlated**.\n",
        "- This causes **unstable coefficient estimates**, making it hard to interpret the model and can lead to **overfitting**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solutions:**\n",
        "-  **Check for multicollinearity** using:\n",
        "  - **Correlation matrix**\n",
        "  - **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: VIF > 5 or 10 indicates a problem.\n",
        "-  **Drop one of the correlated features**\n",
        "-  **Use PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality\n",
        "-  **Use L2 Regularization** (Ridge) to reduce the effect of collinearity\n",
